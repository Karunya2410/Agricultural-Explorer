# Agricultural-Explorer


## Overview
Agricultural Explorer is an interactive data visualization and analysis tool designed to help users explore agricultural production trends, identify key insights, and make data-driven decisions.
## Features
- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Aggregates agricultural data from government sources, surveys, and reports. Standardizes units  and handles missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifies trends, patterns, and correlations in agricultural data, highlighting high and low production areas.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Uses **Plotly** to generate real-time visualizations, including:
  - Line charts for time-series data.
  - Bar charts for production comparison across regions.
  - Heatmaps for visualizing crop distribution across states.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides filtering options based on region, crop type, yield, and year. Implements interactive elements like dropdowns, sliders, and tooltips.

## Technology Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Dash)
- **Power BI** (for advanced dashboarding and insights)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for exploratory analysis)
